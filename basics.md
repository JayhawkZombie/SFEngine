# SFEngine Basics

---

So what is the heart and soul of this engine?  Really, half of that is the libraries we use.  This engine would be nothing without them.

First, we should mention all 3rd party libraries we are using, as they quite certainly deserve credit for their wonderful work.

| Link | Why |
| :---: | :---: |
| [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) | Graphics and Audio Wrapper |
| [Thor](http://www.bromeon.ch/libraries/thor) | Animation & Particle Utility |
| [Aurora](http://www.bromeon.ch/libraries/aurora/index.html) | Used Internally by Thor |
| [Selba Ward](https://github.com/Hapaxia/SelbaWard) | Graphical Utilities |
| [IMGUI](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) | Debug/Editor UI |
| [TGUI](https://github.com/texus/TGUI) | In-Game/Release UI |
| [ChaiScript](http://chaiscript.com/) | Runtime Scripting |
| [JsonCPP](https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) | Data Saving |
| [cereal](https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal) | Object Serialization |



We saw no reason to reinvent the wheel here, and these libraries do it better than we could.  Besides, using them allows us to remain open-sourced and we can develop more quickly

All of these libraries are open-source, and any distribution of our engine will be accompanied by a copy of their source.
