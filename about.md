### SFEngine - So what is it?

###### So glad you asked!

It's a free, open-source game engine.  It is written entirely in C++ and uses SFML as a graphics and audio wrapper.

### So what can it do?

###### You ask such great questions!

It can do dynamic lighting \(though our algorithms are imperfect\), the environments are dynamic, there is event sequencing - both timed and untimed - can animate sprites \(and can leverage a callback system to let you know when your animation is complete!\). It supports particle effects, spline-based path assignments, time dilation effects, and interactable objects. The physics engine we're using even simulated fluid dynamics!

It is not fully-featured, but we're working on it!
