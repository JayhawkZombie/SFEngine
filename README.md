# SFEngine
SFEngine - A free, open-source game engine built on SFML  

**This code is in the process of being migrated - it is not ready to be used yet**  

## **Status Update: 7/5/2017**  
This code is still in the process of being moved, taking much longer than expected.  I determined the editing UI system needed to be written custom to gain the freedom necessary.  Expected date for push: 7/14/2017  

[**GitBook Documentation**](https://www.gitbook.com/book/jayhawkzombie/sfengine-docs/details)  

Please read the Wiki [here](https://github.com/JayhawkZombie/SFEngine/wiki/Installing-&-Running-The-Engine) to see how to set up your environment to be able to compile and use the engine.  If you're on Windows 10, you can just download and go!  

This is migrated from a senior engineering design [project](https://github.com/JayhawkZombie/EECS581Project)
