Okay, so each menu screen has those two big circles in the upper right and left hand corners
This is where the symbols go, and this is the page thats going to help you do it

All 36 subtrees will have these textures applied.
The mapping for the location of these symbols is found in the 
GameMain::Symbols which will return the filepath to the texture. if you needed to call the texture for 1 3, then
GameMain::Symbols()[1][3] will return the filepath to that texture.

Texture 1: 
Location:
x   y   w   h
5   5   16  16

render the texture found at GameMain::Symbols()[x][y] where x and y are the indexes cooresponding to the current tree

Texture 2:
Location:
x   y   w   h
123 5   16  16

Same texture as above
