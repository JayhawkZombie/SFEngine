The infant is rendered to 
x    y    w    h
75   118  16   16

this means the textures you are looking for are avaliable in 
MonsterArray[x][y][1][0]->getTexture();
x could be :  0   2   5
y could be :  1   5   4

It bears mentioning that the filePath returned is associated with the
entire animation, you only want to render from 0,0 to 15,15 of the texture file


but the button should encapsulate the area
