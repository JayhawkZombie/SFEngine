It is wrong that he is still so fixated on the loss of one long departed. As his friend, I must refuse, I do not wish to enable such sinful sorrow.

Are you telling me that after all the years we have come to church and supported you, you would still refuse such a simple request?

After all of the things my mother did for this church you're really not going to say a prayer over her?


There is a place for sorrow yes, but there is a place for life as well. We should dwell in sorrow only as long as we need, it is pleasing to the gods for us to live a joyful life.

There are six, and One. The god above who showed Prophet Erebius his light showed us six faces: Anu, the father of light, Ahros the Judge, Velhu the merciful, Sid the compassionate, and Pythion, the Redeemer who was redeemed.

How can there be both six and one?
